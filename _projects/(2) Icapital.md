# The Movies Project

<!--- The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
This micro-service system uses some front-end frameworks including Vue JS, PHP Orchid, and PHP Blade and for back-end it was built using PHP Laravel, Express JS, Google Cloud, and Firebase. Fixing bugs, satisfying new requirements, and writing unit tests at both server, user-web and admin web is the primary things I do. Recently, I have implemented SSO system like Keycloak using Firebase Authentication, Firebase Admin SDK, and Google Cloud Functions.-->
